Test Failures Due to Environment Switch – Fix Estimation

Dear Stakeholders,

The existing automation test cases were originally designed to run against the Stage environment, with data and object locators tailored accordingly. Upon executing the same suite in the Test environment as requested, we have encountered several test failures due to environment-specific differences.




We are currently analyzing the failures and estimating approximately [insert estimated time, e.g., 2–3 working days] to refactor the scripts and resolve the issues for Test environment compatibility.

I will keep you updated on the progress and inform you once the suite is stable and ready for execution in Test.ur updates. QA team, let’s begin with you.”

Subject: Action Required: Update of Impacted Object Locators in TST Environment

Hi Team,

As part of the Siebel upgrade from version 23 to 25, we have identified around 250 impacted object locators across various modules. These updates are required due to changes in applet names (e.g., "Search Applet" is now "Search"), which are affecting automation execution in the TST environment.

To streamline the update process, the impacted objects have been divided among the three of you as per the allocation below.
For tracking purposes, please populate the attached sheet with the updated status once you complete each item.

Allocation:
	•	[Member 1] – Module A, B
	•	[Member 2] – Module C, D
	•	[Member 3] – Module E, F

Please ensure the object locators are updated and corresponding test cases are passing in the TST environment. Let me know if you face any blockers.

Request to Run Sequence Job for CSC VIP Checkbox Match-Merge Validation

Hi [Data Team/Team Member’s Name],

Hope you’re doing well.

Could you please help run the sequence job to validate one of the match-merge scenarios related to the CSC VIP checkbox? We need to verify if the merge logic is correctly handling records with this attribute.

Let me know once it’s triggered or if you need any specific inputs from my side.

Thanks,
