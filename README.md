Subject: Scenarios & Test Data Setup for Companies and Contacts – Review Requested

Hi [Business Tester’s Name],

Please find below the list of test scenarios for Companies and Contacts, along with the corresponding test data setup. The same scenarios have been applied for both entities.

The test data has been prepared to undergo the Match-Merge job by keeping the Name, Phone Number, and Address consistent across records. Kindly review the scenarios and data setup, and let me know if there are any additional scenarios you’d like us to cover.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
