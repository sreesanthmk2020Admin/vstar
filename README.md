Method 3 – New View Validation
	•	Validate the newly added view for standard functionality including:
	•	Search
	•	Add
	•	Delete
	•	Update
	•	Ensure the view behaves correctly across modules (e.g., Companies and other related modules), as the sensitive comment field allows drill-down navigation to this view.
	•	Verify:
	•	Drill-down functionality works as expected.
	•	Access control rules are enforced.
	•	Data consistency is maintained across modules.
	•	No unintended visibility of sensitive data.
