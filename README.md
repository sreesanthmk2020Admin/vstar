🔹 A. CRM Application & Architecture Alignment

These questions show technical foresight and understanding of system-level implications:
	1.	“Do we know if the target CRM system post-merger will be Siebel-centric or Salesforce-centric, or if we’ll operate in a coexistence model temporarily?”
	2.	“Will there be a phased migration of Comerica customer data, or a single cutover strategy?”
	3.	“Are we expecting any middleware or integration layer upgrades (like OIC, MuleSoft, or Kafka) to handle cross-system sync?”
	4.	“Is there any plan to standardize APIs or message structures between Siebel and Comerica’s systems for the merged operations?”

⸻

🔹 B. QA / Test Strategy and Ownership

These establish your thought leadership in QA automation and test architecture:
	1.	“Will CRM integration testing fall under our team’s scope, or will there be a shared QA ownership model across both banks?”
	2.	“Should we start planning a data validation framework to compare Siebel vs. Comerica CRM records during migration testing?”
	3.	“Is there a plan for test data anonymization or masking since we’ll be dealing with merged customer PII data?”
	4.	“Would you like me to start preparing a CRM regression impact assessment to identify reusable test packs post-merger?”

⸻

🔹 C. Infrastructure & Access Readiness

This shows proactive readiness for environment and connectivity challenges:
	1.	“Will we get sandbox or pre-production environments that mirror both CRM systems for integration testing?”
	2.	“Do we need to prepare for increased environment load or performance testing, considering merged data volumes?”
	3.	“Are there any upcoming access requests or environment provisioning dependencies I should initiate early?”

⸻

🔹 D. Project Planning & Cross-Team Collaboration

These questions demonstrate leadership and alignment with program-level goals:
	1.	“When the CRM merger stream officially kicks off, who will be our key stakeholders from the Comerica and Fifth Third sides?”
	2.	“Are we planning any joint system walkthroughs or knowledge-transfer sessions with Comerica’s CRM SMEs?”
	3.	“Would it be valuable if I draft a high-level test readiness plan for CRM integration so we can align with the PMO early?”

⸻

🔹 Bonus (High-Maturity Questions)

These subtly elevate your positioning:
	•	“Do we plan to establish a centralized defect triage for CRM integration-related defects, given the multi-system dependencies?”
	•	“Would the leadership expect automation coverage metrics for data migration and regression to be part of merger reporting?”
