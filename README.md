Thank you for the clarification.

The task created was specifically for the RMT submission seed data locator component, which was the immediate requirement identified. This component is reusable and can support similar scenarios going forward.

For regression, existing test cases continue to use their current data setup. Post-deployment validation is covered through our regular regression/sanity execution. We can further enhance coverage if needed.
