CRM Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document

Project: Fifth Third Bank – CRM
Audience: New QA Joiner (Fresher)
KT Duration: 5 Days (30 minutes/day)
Prepared by: [Your Name]

⸻

1. Introduction to CRM in Fifth Third Bank

1.1 What is CRM?

CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a system used by Fifth Third Bank to:
	•	Maintain customer and account information
	•	Track customer interactions
	•	Manage service requests and issues
	•	Support banking operations and compliance

CRM acts as a single source of truth for customer-related data.

⸻

2. CRM Architecture – High-Level View

2.1 Systems Interaction
	•	CRM (Siebel) – Front-end user application
	•	Backend Systems – Core banking, data warehouse, external apps
	•	Batch / Sequence Jobs – Sync data between backend and CRM UI
	•	ACE / Other Apps – Integrations that consume or push data to CRM

CRM UI does not always update immediately—many changes happen through backend jobs.

3. Core CRM Entities (Used in Fifth Third Bank)

3.1 Contacts
	•	Represents an individual customer

4.2 Views

Different layouts under a screen
Example: List View, Detail View

Small UI components inside a view:
	•	List Applet (multiple records)
	•	Form Applet (single record)

4.4 List View vs Form View

	•	Form View: Shows detailed data of one record

⸻

5. Key CRM Functionalities

5.1 Query & Search

5.2 LOV (List of Values)
	•	Predefined value list used in:
	•	Dropdowns
	•	Column headers
	•	Must display correctly (common defect area)

⸻

5.3 Backend Jobs / Bubble-Up
	•	Backend jobs update CRM UI
	•	Example:
	•	Data created in DB → Job runs → Data appears in UI
	•	QA validates:
	•	Backend data
	•	UI reflection

⸻

5.4 Match-Merge
	•	Identifies duplicate records
	•	Matches based on:
	•	Name

	•	Incorrect UI column headers
	•	Data mismatch between backend and UI
	•	Checkbox behavior (Y/N vs Checked)
	•	Performance delays after fixes

⸻

8. Tools Used
