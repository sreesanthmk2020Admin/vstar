Point 1:
“The new view and columns are functionally correct, but the column widths are very wide and introduce a horizontal scroll bar. As per previous LOB feedback for similar components, the column widths should be kept nominal to avoid scrolling.”

Point 2:
“The checkbox field is not retaining its checked/unchecked state consistently and is displaying ‘Y’ or ‘N’ in some cases. This needs to be corrected to reflect the actual checkbox behavior.”
“The new view and columns added by the developers are functionally correct, but the column widths are currently very wide and introduce a horizontal scroll bar. We previously received LOB feedback for a similar UI component, requesting column widths to be kept nominal to avoid scrolling. Recommending the same adjustment here to improve usability and maintain consistency.”
