Subject: Update on LOV Sorting Validation – Findings and Status

Hi [Name/Team],

As part of the user story for validating the alphabetical sorting of LOVs, I have completed the checks across all relevant dropdown fields, including the hierarchical fields (Product → Service → Issue) based on their dependent selections.

During this validation, I identified five LOVs that are not sorted in the expected alphabetical order. The details are as follows:
	1.	[LOV Name 1] – [Issue summary]
	2.	[LOV Name 2] – [Issue summary]
	3.	[LOV Name 3] – [Issue summary]
	4.	[LOV Name 4] – [Issue summary]
	5.	[LOV Name 5] – [Issue summary]

Please confirm if defects should be logged for these observations.

This story extended across multiple sprints due to Katalon automation challenges in handling dynamic hierarchical LOVs and other higher-priority QA items during the same period. These issues have now been addressed, and the validation is complete.

Kindly let me know if any further checks or updates are required.

Regards,
