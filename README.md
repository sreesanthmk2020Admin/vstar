Subject: Addendum – Additional LOV Sorting Observation

Hi [Name/Team],

Following the earlier update on the LOV sorting validation, I would like to add one more observation. During an extended review, I identified an additional LOV that is not sorted in the expected alphabetical order:
	•	[LOV Name] – [Issue summary]

This brings the total count of impacted LOVs to six.
Please let me know if this should also be logged as a defect along with the previously reported items.



Subject: Additional LOV to Be Included Under Agreed Work Order

Hi [Name/Team],

Following the agreement to proceed with the Work Order approach, I would like to highlight that one more LOV has been identified that requires inclusion under the same scope.
	•	[LOV Name] – [Issue summary]

This LOV also displays an alphabetical sorting issue and should be considered along with the previously noted items.

Please let me know if you would like this added to the existing Work Order list.

Regards,
