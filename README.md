Subject: CRM Sign-off Status Update – [Release/Change Name]

Hi [Manager’s Name],

Just to update, there is no sign-off required from the CRM team for this release, as there are no functional changes in CRM. The ACE team was responsible for the validation and has already provided their sign-off, as confirmed by [XXXX Person’s Name].

Please let me know if any further confirmation is needed from my side.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
