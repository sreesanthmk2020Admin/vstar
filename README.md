Defect Summary:
Incorrect data displayed under correct column header in provided data file

Defect Description:
The developer has completed the fix and shared two data files for validation. In one of the files, although the column header is correct, the data populated under that column is incorrect and does not match the expected values. The other file appears to be correct. This indicates a data mapping or population issue specific to the impacted file and needs correction.
